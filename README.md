# ImageSlider
Image Slider Project
This project is a simple and interactive image slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider allows users to click on any image to initiate a smooth transition to the next one in the collection. I gathered a set of images from the internet and implemented a responsive slider where each click seamlessly displays the next image in the sequence.

Features:
Responsive Design: The slider adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
Click Navigation: Users can click on any image to move to the next, making it intuitive and easy to use.
Smooth Transitions: Implemented using CSS animations for a polished, professional look.
Lightweight and Fast: Minimal code with no external dependencies for quick loading times.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the slider layout.
CSS3: For styling the images and creating smooth transition effects.
JavaScript: For handling the click events and controlling the image transitions.
How to Use:
